-  Description:
The cryptography category is incomplete without RSA. So here is a simple RSA challenge. Have fun!

# Writeup
The vulnerability here is that the exponent is very small i.e 3 so it's easy to compute the e-th root of `c` to recover the flag. Solution at `solve/solve.py`

# Flag :- n00bz{crypt0_1s_1nc0mpl3t3_w1th0ut_rs4!!}
