# Write-up

Google something like "blue background with white flower airline logo". It will take you to a link on wikipedia with all airlines and their logos. Go to the plants section and it's the fourth one. Go to the wiki of that airline and it will give you the airline hub. IATA code for the same: PPT. 

# Flag - n00bz{PPT}
